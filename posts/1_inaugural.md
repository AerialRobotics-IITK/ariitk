Hello World.

This is an inaugural post stating that we're back on!  
Yes, Team ARIITK is full on track to serve as **the group** of undergraduates in IITK that has complete autonomous aerial vehicle solutions.  
Our team founders had joined up together to tackle a novel PS, and we are trying to continue the same.  
Due to the pandemic situation, the team had been passed down, but it forgot how to handle an actual unmanned vehicle. Since October 2022, we restarted handling the inventory laid at our hands, and have come a long way since.
Briefing the inventory, we received the _inheritance_ of the following:

1. `Computing Units:` Two Jetson TX2s, One Odroid H2, Two Odroid XU4s, One Xilinx, One Intel Celeron NUC
2. `Motors:` AirGear 880kv, KDE 920kv, Antigravity, EMax

We made 3 drones since then, using the same inventory with a few minor additions.
We have tackled with outdoor autonomous navigation and laid our hands on pick-up-delivery problem as well. Also taking part in InterIIT Techmeet this year had us deal with sending protocol packets directly to a flight controller and handling position control of a drone only using a single monocular camera, creating and tuning controllers from scratch in the process. We are just getting started.  
Stay tuned.
